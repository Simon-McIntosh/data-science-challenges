    "# MAST Plasma Equilibrium Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to predict two-dimensional poloidal flux maps from diagnostic measurements using EFIT++ equilibrium reconstruction code outputs to train and test models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Run the `Plasma Equilibrium Dataset.ipynb` notebook first to download the dataset from the FAIR-MAST server. This will place the necessary data files in the `fair_mast_data/plasma_equilibrium` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the third data science challenge from the ITER International School 2024 series. The challenge focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Applying signal selection techniques to diverse input sets\n",
    "2. Implementing effective normalization strategies \n",
    "3. Predicting 2D spatial targets from 1D signal inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "![Equilibrium Animation](../media/images/equilibrium.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenge Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal Processing**: Process heterogeneous diagnostic signals from tokamak experiments\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Transformation**: Transform 1D time-series inputs into 2D spatial maps\n",
    "- **Validation Methods**: Evaluate flux map prediction accuracy with appropriate metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The EFIT++ code reconstructs plasma equilibrium by combining external and internal diagnostic measurements. The animation above shows poloidal flux contour evolution over time for one MAST shot from the training dataset. While displayed as mirrored for illustration, the plasma equilibria are axisymmetric on the poloidal r, z plane.\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Poloidal magnetic flux represents the integral of the vertical magnetic field component passing through a disc. This disc is bound by an r, z point on the poloidal plane and aligned with the z-axis. The unit of measurement is Weber (Wb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you must predict:\n",
    "1. The poloidal flux map shape\n",
    "2. The flux values at specific time points\n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset contains 1D and 2D inputs from these MAST signal groups:\n",
    "- magnetics\n",
    "- spectrometer_visible\n",
    "- soft_x_rays\n",
    "- thomson_scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "Success requires selecting optimal diagnostic groups and signals to maximize the fit between training data and unseen targets. This demands both intuition about signal meaning and systematic experimentation. Consider transforming input data to generate additional useful signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that signals span widely different scales. You must develop effective preprocessing to normalize inputs for good results.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Understanding Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we evaluate our model using the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** metric. Let's understand what this means in the context of our plasma equilibrium prediction task:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is MAE?**\n",
    "MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, without considering their direction. Mathematically, it's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y_i$ represents the true flux value\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted flux value\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of points being evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use MAE for this challenge?**\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE is particularly suitable for the plasma equilibrium prediction task because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical Interpretation**: In the context of poloidal flux maps, MAE directly tells us the average absolute deviation (in Weber units) between our predicted flux values and the ground truth EFIT++ values across all grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness**: Unlike Mean Squared Error (MSE), MAE is less sensitive to outliers, which can be important when dealing with plasma diagnostics that may occasionally have measurement spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Same Units**: MAE preserves the original units of our target variable (Weber), making the error value physically interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting the MAE value:**\n",
    "- Lower values indicate better model performance\n",
    "- The theoretical best value is 0 (perfect prediction)\n",
    "- The MAE should be considered in context of the range and physical meaning of the flux values\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, high-quality equilibrium reconstructions typically achieve MAE values in the order of 10^-3 to 10^-4 Weber when compared to ground truth. The exact threshold for \"good performance\" depends on the specific application and required accuracy for plasma control or analysis tasks."

    "### Using the Contour Class\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the visualization tools, we first initialize the `Contour` class with a `magnetic_flux` DataArray. This DataArray should contain the magnetic flux values on a poloidal grid. The `Contour` class uses this information to create contour plots of the magnetic flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to initialize the `Contour` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from your_module import Contour\n",
    "import xarray as xr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming magnetic_flux_data is your DataArray containing magnetic flux values\n",
    "contour = Contour(magnetic_flux_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `Contour` class is initialized, you can use its methods to create various visualizations of the magnetic flux. For example, to create a basic contour plot, you can use the `contour_plot` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contour.contour_plot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a contour plot of the magnetic flux on the poloidal grid. You can customize the plot by adjusting the parameters of the `contour_plot` method. For example, you can change the contour levels, add labels, and modify the color map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the documentation of the `Contour` class for more details on the available methods and their usage."

    "## Model Assessment and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simple linear regression model provides a baseline for plasma equilibrium reconstruction. However, there are several improvements we can make to enhance performance, ranging from simple techniques to more advanced approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Improvements with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations can be implemented using the current dataset and scikit-learn library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Diagnostic Signal Integration**:\n",
    "   - Including signals from multiple diagnostic groups (magnetics, soft_x_rays, thomson_scattering) significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to using a single group\n",
    "   - Combining complementary information from different measurement systems helps capture more aspects of the plasma state\n",
    "   - Feature importance analysis can identify which diagnostic signals contribute most to accurate reconstructions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering Strategies Based on Rate of Change of Plasma Current**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def calculate_didt(time_series, plasma_current):\n",
    "       \"\"\"Calculate rate of change of plasma current.\"\"\"\n",
    "       return np.gradient(plasma_current, time_series)\n",
    "\n",
    "   def apply_didt_filter(X, y, time, plasma_current, threshold=1e5):  # threshold in A/s\n",
    "       \"\"\"Filter training data based on rate of change of plasma current.\"\"\"\n",
    "       didt = calculate_didt(time, plasma_current)\n",
    "       stable_indices = np.abs(didt) < threshold\n",
    "       return X[stable_indices], y[stable_indices]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This approach enables:\n",
    "   - Regime separation for training separate models for \"slow evolution\" versus \"fast transient\" phases\n",
    "   - Improved signal quality by filtering out noisy transient periods\n",
    "   - Better physical consistency as stable periods follow MHD equilibrium more closely\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Apply standard scaling to normalize heterogeneous diagnostic signals\n",
    "   - Use robust scaling for signals with outliers\n",
    "   - Implement feature selection to identify the most informative signals\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, RobustScaler\n",
    "   from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Example pipeline with preprocessing\n",
    "   pipeline = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(\n",
    "       RobustScaler(),\n",
    "       SelectKBest(f_regression, k=20),  # Select top 20 features\n",
    "       sklearn.linear_model.Ridge(alpha=0.1)  # Regularized regression\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Selection and Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Explore regularized models (Ridge, Lasso) to handle high-dimensional data\n",
    "   - Use non-linear models such as RandomForest or GradientBoosting\n",
    "   - Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n",
    "   from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Example grid search\n",
    "   param_grid = {\n",
    "       'gradientboostingregressor__n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],\n",
    "       'gradientboostingregressor__learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],\n",
    "       'gradientboostingregressor__max_depth': [3, 5, 7]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pipeline = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(\n",
    "       StandardScaler(),\n",
    "       GradientBoostingRegressor()\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   \n",
    "   grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=3, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')\n",
    "   grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Approaches (Requiring Custom Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches would require more significant custom implementation beyond scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physics-Informed Machine Learning**:\n",
    "   - Incorporate MHD equilibrium constraints (∇p = j × B) into model architecture\n",
    "   - Use variational autoencoders to learn physically consistent equilibrium representations\n",
    "   - Apply transfer learning from simulated equilibria to experimental data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Signal Processing**:\n",
    "   - Apply wavelet transforms to identify and filter transient events\n",
    "   - Use Kalman filtering to track equilibrium evolution with physical constraints\n",
    "   - Implement sensor fusion techniques to optimally combine heterogeneous diagnostic signals\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Passive Current Modeling**:\n",
    "   - Model vessel geometry and electrical properties to account for passive currents\n",
    "   - Develop eddy current evolution models with appropriate time constants\n",
    "   - Use measurement redundancy to disambiguate plasma versus passive current effects\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deep Learning Approaches**:\n",
    "   - Implement neural networks with convolutional layers for spatial structure learning\n",
    "   - Use recurrent neural networks (LSTM/GRU) to capture temporal evolution\n",
    "   - Develop physics-constrained loss functions that enforce known plasma behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sophisticated Validation**:\n",
    "   - Cross-validate against other equilibrium codes (EFIT, CLISTE, LIUQE)\n",
    "   - Compare with direct internal measurements (Thomson scattering, MSE)\n",
    "   - Evaluate reconstructions against known plasma physics constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these physical aspects can guide model development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plasma Current Distribution Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - Axisymmetry around the toroidal axis (neglects 3D effects)\n",
    "   - Current profile smoothness (may not capture sharp gradients)\n",
    "   - Time independence between consecutive time points\n",
    "   - Fixed boundary constraints for the plasma current\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Passive Current Effects**:\n",
    "   - Passive currents generate confounding magnetic field signals\n",
    "   - Time-dependent evolution differs from plasma current dynamics\n",
    "   - Complex 3D spatial distribution affects measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing the simpler improvements first and gradually incorporating more advanced techniques as needed, we can systematically enhance the accuracy and reliability of plasma equilibrium reconstruction from magnetic measurements."
